                Ingredients:

               <p> 250g paneer (cottage cheese), cubed
                300g fresh spinach (palak), washed and chopped
                1 large onion, finely chopped
                2 large tomatoes, chopped
                1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste
                2 green chilies, chopped (adjust to taste)
                1 teaspoon cumin seeds
                1 teaspoon garam masala
                1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
                1 teaspoon cumin powder
                1 teaspoon coriander powder
                1/2 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)
                1/2 cup heavy cream or cashew cream
                Salt to taste
                2 tablespoons oil or ghee</p>
                Instructions:
                
               <p> Blanch the spinach: Boil water in a pot and blanch the chopped spinach for about 2 minutes. Drain and immediately transfer to a bowl of ice water. This helps retain the vibrant green color. Blend the blanched spinach to a smooth paste and set aside.
                
                In a pan, heat oil or ghee over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter. Then, add chopped onions and sauté until golden brown.
                
                Add ginger-garlic paste and chopped green chilies. Sauté for a minute until the raw smell disappears.
                
                Add chopped tomatoes, turmeric powder, cumin powder, coriander powder, and red chili powder. Cook until the tomatoes become soft and oil starts to separate from the masala.
                
                Let the mixture cool down a bit, and then blend it into a smooth paste.
                
                Return the blended mixture to the pan. Add the spinach paste and mix well. Cook for a few minutes, allowing the flavors to combine.
                
                Stir in the garam masala and salt. If the mixture is too thick, you can add a little water to achieve your desired consistency.
                
                Add the paneer cubes and cook for another 3-4 minutes, allowing them to absorb the flavors.
                
                Finally, stir in the heavy cream or cashew cream to make the dish rich and creamy. You can adjust the quantity of cream according to your preference.
                
                Simmer the Palak Paneer for a few more minutes, ensuring the paneer is well-cooked and the flavors are well-incorporated.
                
                Serve hot with roti, naan, or rice.
                
                Enjoy your flavorful Palak Paneer dish!</p>
