Ingredients:

For Rajma (Kidney Bean Curry):

<p>1 cup dried rajma (kidney beans), soaked overnight and drained
1 large onion, finely chopped
2 large tomatoes, pureed
2-3 cloves of garlic, minced
1-inch piece of ginger, minced
2-3 green chilies, slit (adjust to taste)
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 teaspoon red chili powder
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
1 teaspoon garam masala
1 teaspoon ground coriander
Salt to taste
2 tablespoons oil or ghee
Chopped fresh coriander leaves for garnishing</p>
For Chawal (Rice):

<p>1 cup basmati rice
Water for cooking
Salt to taste</p>
Instructions:

For Rajma:

<p>In a pressure cooker or large pot, heat oil or ghee over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.
Add chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.
Add minced ginger, garlic, and green chilies. Sauté for a couple of minutes until the raw smell disappears.
Add tomato puree, red chili powder, turmeric powder, ground coriander, and salt. Cook the masala until the oil starts to separate from it.
Add soaked and drained rajma (kidney beans) to the masala. Mix well to coat the beans with the spices.
Add water to cover the beans (about 2-3 cups), close the pressure cooker lid, and cook on medium heat for about 15-20 minutes or until the rajma is soft and well-cooked. If using a pot, it might take longer.
Once the rajma is cooked, mash some of the beans to thicken the curry. Add garam masala and adjust salt if needed. Simmer for a few more minutes.</p>
For Chawal:

<p>Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear.
In a pot, bring water to a boil. Add the rinsed rice and salt.
Cook the rice until it's 70-80% cooked (it should have a slight bite to it). Drain the water.</p>
To Serve:

<p>Serve the hot rajma curry over a portion of cooked rice (chawal).
Garnish with chopped fresh coriander leaves.
Rajma Chawal is often accompanied by plain yogurt, chopped onions, and a squeeze of lemon.
Enjoy your homemade Rajma Chawal!

Note: Cooking times and quantities may vary, so adjust them according to your preferences and kitchen equipment</p>
