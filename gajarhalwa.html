                Ingredients:

<p>500g carrots, grated
1 cup milk
1/2 cup sugar (adjust to taste)
1/4 cup ghee (clarified butter)
1/4 cup chopped nuts (cashews, almonds, pistachios)
1/2 tsp cardamom powder
A pinch of saffron strands (optional)
Raisins for garnishing</p>
Instructions:

<p>Heat the ghee in a heavy-bottomed pan. Add the grated carrots and saut√© on medium heat for 5-7 minutes, until they soften and release their aroma.

Add the milk to the carrots and cook on low-medium heat. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. The carrots will absorb the milk and start to cook down.

When the carrots are almost cooked and the milk has reduced, add the sugar and continue cooking. The sugar will release moisture, so cook until most of the moisture evaporates and the halwa thickens.

Add the chopped nuts, cardamom powder, and saffron strands (if using). Mix well and continue cooking for another 5-7 minutes.

Keep stirring until the halwa reaches a thick, pudding-like consistency and starts to leave the sides of the pan. This can take about 20-30 minutes.

Once the halwa is ready, remove it from the heat and let it cool slightly.

Garnish with raisins and more chopped nuts.

Serve the Gajar Halwa warm. It can be enjoyed on its own or with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Enjoy your delicious homemade Gajar Halwa!</p>
