                Ingredients:

                <p>1 cup poha (flattened rice)
                1 medium-sized onion, finely chopped
                1-2 green chilies, chopped (adjust to taste)
                1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds
                1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
                A pinch of asafoetida (hing)
                8-10 curry leaves
                1/4 cup peanuts
                1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder
                Salt to taste
                Juice of 1 lemon
                Fresh coriander leaves, chopped, for garnishing
                Oil (preferably peanut or vegetable oil)</p>
                Instructions:
                
                <p>Rinse the poha thoroughly in a colander under cold running water. Let it sit for about 5 minutes to soften. Gently fluff it with a fork to separate the grains. Set aside.
                Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add mustard seeds and let them splutter, then add cumin seeds, asafoetida, and curry leaves.
                Add chopped green chilies, and peanuts. Saut√© until the peanuts are lightly roasted.
                Add chopped onions and cook until they turn translucent.
                Add turmeric powder and mix well.
                Add the softened poha to the pan. Mix gently to combine all the ingredients. Cook for a few minutes until the poha is heated through.
                Sprinkle salt and lemon juice over the poha. Mix well. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed.
                Cover the pan with a lid and let the poha cook for another 2-3 minutes on low heat.
                Turn off the heat and let the poha rest for a minute or two.
                Garnish with freshly chopped coriander leaves before serving.
                Your poha is now ready to be served. Enjoy it as a delicious and comforting breakfast dish!
                
                Feel free to customize the recipe by adding ingredients like grated coconut, chopped tomatoes, or even some boiled potatoes for extra flavor and texture.</p>
