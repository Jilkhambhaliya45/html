                Ingredients:

                For the koftas:
                
                <p>2 cups boiled and mashed potatoes
                1/2 cup grated paneer (Indian cottage cheese)
                1/4 cup grated carrots
                1/4 cup green peas (boiled and mashed)
                2 tbsp corn flour or all-purpose flour
                Salt to taste
                1/2 tsp red chili powder
                1/2 tsp garam masala
                Oil for frying</p>
                For the gravy:
                
                <p>1 cup onion-tomato paste (blend together 2 onions and 2 tomatoes)
                1 tsp ginger paste
                1 tsp garlic paste
                1/2 cup fresh cream (malai)
                1/4 cup cashew nut paste (soaked and blended)
                1/2 tsp turmeric powder
                1 tsp red chili powder
                1 tsp coriander powder
                1 tsp cumin powder
                1/2 tsp garam masala
                Salt to taste
                2 tbsp oil
                1 tbsp butter
                1 cup water
                Chopped cilantro (coriander leaves) for garnishing</p>
                Instructions:
                
                <p>In a mixing bowl, combine the boiled and mashed potatoes, grated paneer, grated carrots, mashed green peas, corn flour (or all-purpose flour), salt, red chili powder, and garam masala. Mix well and form small balls. Heat oil in a pan and fry the koftas until they are golden brown. Drain on a paper towel.
                
                In a separate pan, heat oil and butter. Add ginger paste and garlic paste, and saut√© for a minute. Add the onion-tomato paste and cook until the mixture thickens and the oil starts to separate.
                
                Add turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, and salt. Mix well and cook for a few minutes.
                
                Lower the heat and add the cashew nut paste, stirring continuously. Once the mixture thickens, add water and bring it to a simmer.
                
                Add fresh cream (malai) and garam masala. Mix well and simmer for a few more minutes.
                
                Just before serving, place the fried koftas in the serving dish and pour the hot gravy over them.
                
                Garnish with chopped cilantro and a swirl of fresh cream.
                
                Serve the Malai Kofta with naan, roti, or rice.
                
                Enjoy your delicious homemade Malai Kofta!
