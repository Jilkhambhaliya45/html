                Ingredients:

               <p> 1 cup basmati rice
                1/2 cup yellow split moong dal (lentils)
                2 tablespoons ghee or oil
                1 teaspoon cumin seeds
                1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds
                1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
                1/2 teaspoon cumin powder
                1/2 teaspoon coriander powder
                Pinch of asafoetida (hing)
                1-2 green chilies, chopped
                1 medium onion, finely chopped
                1 medium tomato, chopped
                1/2 cup mixed vegetables (carrots, peas, beans), chopped
                Salt to taste
                4 cups water
                Fresh cilantro leaves, chopped (for garnish)</p>
                Instructions:
                
                <p>Wash the rice and lentils together under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak them for about 30 minutes, then drain.
                In a large pot, heat ghee or oil over medium heat. Add cumin seeds, mustard seeds, and asafoetida. Let them splutter.
                Add chopped onions and green chilies. Sauté until the onions turn translucent.
                Stir in the turmeric, cumin powder, and coriander powder. Cook for a minute until fragrant.
                Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften.
                Add the mixed vegetables and sauté for a few minutes.
                Add the soaked rice and lentils, along with 4 cups of water. Add salt to taste and mix well.
                Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and let it simmer for about 20-25 minutes, or until the rice and lentils are cooked and the khichdi reaches the desired consistency. You can add more water if needed.
                Once cooked, turn off the heat and let the khichdi sit for 5-10 minutes before fluffing it with a fork.
                Garnish with chopped cilantro leaves.
                Serve hot khichdi with yogurt, pickles, or papadum.
                Enjoy your homemade khichdi!</p>
