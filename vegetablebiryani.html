                Ingredients:

<p>For the Rice:</p>

<p>2 cups Basmati rice
4 cups water
1 bay leaf
2-3 cloves
2-3 green cardamom pods
Salt to taste
For the Vegetable Mixture:

2 cups mixed vegetables (carrots, beans, peas, potatoes, etc.)
1 large onion, thinly sliced
2-3 green chilies, slit
1 teaspoon ginger paste
1 teaspoon garlic paste
1/2 cup plain yogurt
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)
1 teaspoon garam masala
Salt to taste
Fresh coriander leaves and mint leaves, chopped</p>
<p>For Layering:

Saffron strands soaked in warm milk
Fried onions (from the sliced onion)
Ghee or oil
Fresh coriander leaves and mint leaves</p>
Instructions:

<p>Wash the rice thoroughly and soak it in water for about 30 minutes. Drain and set aside.
In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Add the soaked and drained rice, bay leaf, cloves, green cardamom pods, and salt. Cook until the rice is 70% cooked. Drain the rice and set aside.
In a separate pan, heat ghee or oil. Add the sliced onions and fry until they turn golden brown. Remove half of the fried onions and set aside for layering.
In the same pan, add the green chilies, ginger paste, and garlic paste. Saut√© for a minute.
Add the mixed vegetables and cook for a few minutes. Then, add the turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Mix well.
Stir in the yogurt and cook until the vegetables are tender and the mixture is well combined.
Add garam masala, chopped coriander leaves, and mint leaves. Mix gently.
In a large pot, layer half of the vegetable mixture at the bottom, followed by half of the partially cooked rice. Sprinkle some saffron milk, fried onions, ghee or oil, and chopped coriander and mint leaves.
Repeat the layering with the remaining vegetable mixture and rice. Add the remaining saffron milk, fried onions, ghee or oil, and chopped coriander and mint leaves on top.
Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and place it on low heat. You can also place a tava (griddle) under the pot to distribute the heat evenly.
Cook the biryani on low heat for about 20-25 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the rice to cook completely.
Once done, remove from heat and let it rest for 10 minutes before gently fluffing the rice with a fork.
Serve the delicious vegetable biryani with raita or a side salad.
Enjoy your homemade vegetable biryani!</p>
