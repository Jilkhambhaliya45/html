                Ingredients:

<p>For the Dosa Batter:

1 cup uncooked rice
1/4 cup urad dal (split black gram)
1/4 teaspoon fenugreek seeds (methi seeds)
Water (for soaking and grinding)
Salt to taste
For the Potato Filling (Masala):

3-4 medium-sized potatoes, boiled, peeled, and mashed
1 onion, finely chopped
2-3 green chilies, chopped (adjust to taste)
1 teaspoon mustard seeds
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
A pinch of asafoetida (hing)
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
A few curry leaves
1 tablespoon oil
Salt to taste
Chopped coriander leaves for garnishing</p>
For the Dosa:

<p>Dosa batter
Oil or ghee (clarified butter) for cooking
Water (for thinning the batter, if needed)</p>
Instructions:

For the Dosa Batter:

<p>Wash the rice, urad dal, and fenugreek seeds together in plenty of water. Soak them in water for about 4-6 hours.
Drain the soaked ingredients and grind them to a smooth batter using water as needed. The batter should be slightly coarse in texture.
Add salt to the batter and mix well. Allow the batter to ferment in a warm place for 8-12 hours or overnight.
For the Potato Filling (Masala):

Heat oil in a pan. Add mustard seeds and let them splutter.
Add cumin seeds, asafoetida, and curry leaves. Sauté for a moment.
Add chopped onions and green chilies. Sauté until the onions turn translucent.
Stir in the turmeric powder and mashed potatoes. Mix well.
Cook the mixture for a few minutes, allowing the flavors to blend. Add salt to taste.
Garnish with chopped coriander leaves and set aside.
For Making the Dosa:

Heat a non-stick dosa tawa (griddle) and lightly grease it with oil or ghee.
Take a ladleful of dosa batter and pour it onto the center of the tawa.
Using the back of the ladle, spread the batter in a circular motion to form a thin, even layer.
Drizzle a little oil or ghee around the edges of the dosa.
Cook the dosa on medium heat until it turns golden brown and crispy.
Place a portion of the potato masala filling in the center of the dosa.
Gently fold the dosa in half or roll it into a cylindrical shape.
Serve hot with coconut chutney and sambar.
Enjoy your delicious homemade Masala Dosa!

Note: The dosa batter should be of pouring consistency. If it's too thick, you can add a little water to thin it out.</p>
