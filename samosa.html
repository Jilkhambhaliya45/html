                Ingredients:

For the dough:

<p>2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup oil or ghee
1/2 teaspoon salt
Water, as needed
For the filling:

3-4 medium potatoes, boiled, peeled, and diced
1 cup mixed vegetables (peas, carrots, corn), boiled and drained
1 tablespoon oil
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 teaspoon ginger paste
1 teaspoon green chili paste (adjust to taste)
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon garam masala
Salt, to taste
Fresh coriander leaves, chopped
Lemon juice, to taste</p>
Instructions:

<p>Make the dough: In a large bowl, mix the flour, salt, and oil/ghee. Gradually add water and knead to form a firm dough. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 30 minutes.

Prepare the filling: Heat oil in a pan. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter. Add ginger and green chili paste, and sauté for a minute. Add turmeric, ground coriander, ground cumin, and sauté for another minute.

Add the boiled potatoes and mixed vegetables. Mix well, mashing some of the potatoes. Season with garam masala and salt. Cook for a few minutes. Remove from heat and add chopped coriander leaves and lemon juice. Allow the mixture to cool.

Shape the samosas: Divide the dough into equal portions. Roll each portion into a ball and flatten it into a small disc. Roll out each disc into an oval shape and cut it in half to make two semi-circles.

Form the samosas: Take one semi-circle, wet the straight edge with water, and form a cone shape by folding it in half. Seal the cone. Fill the cone with the prepared filling and seal the open edge to form a triangular samosa. Repeat for the rest.

Heat oil in a deep pan for frying. Once the oil is hot, reduce the heat to medium. Gently slide in a few samosas at a time and fry until golden brown and crispy. Remove and drain on paper towels.

Serve: Enjoy the samosas hot with chutney or sauce of your choice.

Remember, making samosas might require a bit of practice, especially when shaping and sealing them. Good luck, and happy cooking!</p>
