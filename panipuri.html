                Ingredients:

<p>For the Puris:

1 cup semolina (sooji)
1/4 cup all-purpose flour (maida)
A pinch of baking soda
Water (for kneading)
Oil (for deep frying)
For the Pani (Spicy Water):

1 cup fresh mint leaves
1/2 cup fresh coriander leaves
2-3 green chilies (adjust to taste)
1 small piece of ginger
1/4 cup tamarind pulp
1 teaspoon roasted cumin powder
1 teaspoon chaat masala
Black salt (kala namak) to taste
Salt to taste
Water</p>
For the Filling:

<p>1 cup boiled and mashed potatoes
1/2 cup boiled chickpeas
Finely chopped onions
Sweet chutney (made with tamarind and dates)
Nylon sev (thin crispy chickpea flour noodles)</p>
Instructions:

<p>For the Puris:</p>

<p>In a mixing bowl, combine semolina, all-purpose flour, baking soda, and a pinch of salt.
Gradually add water and knead to form a stiff dough.
Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 20-30 minutes.
Divide the dough into small balls and roll them out into small discs.
Heat oil in a pan for deep frying. Once the oil is hot, carefully slide in the rolled puris.
Fry the puris until they puff up and turn golden brown. Remove and drain on paper towels.
For the Pani (Spicy Water):

In a blender, blend mint leaves, coriander leaves, green chilies, and ginger with a little water to form a smooth paste.
Strain the paste using a fine sieve or cloth to extract the juice.
To the extracted juice, add tamarind pulp, roasted cumin powder, chaat masala, black salt, regular salt, and water to taste. Mix well and chill in the refrigerator.
Assembling the Pani Puris:

Make a small hole in the center of each fried puri.
Fill the puris with a mixture of boiled and mashed potatoes, boiled chickpeas, and chopped onions.
Drizzle some sweet chutney into each puri.
Dip the filled puri into the chilled spicy water (pani).
Optionally, top with some nylon sev for extra crunch.
Serve the assembled Pani Puris immediately and enjoy the burst of flavors in every bite!

Note: You can adjust the spice levels and ingredients according to your taste preferences.</p>
