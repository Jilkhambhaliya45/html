                Ingredients:

<p>1 cup masoor dal (red lentils), washed and soaked for 30 minutes
3 cups water
1 medium onion, finely chopped
2 medium tomatoes, chopped
2-3 cloves of garlic, minced
1-inch piece of ginger, grated
1 green chili, slit (adjust to your spice preference)
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 teaspoon mustard seeds
1/2 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)
1/2 teaspoon garam masala
1/2 teaspoon cumin powder
1/2 teaspoon coriander powder
Salt to taste
2 tablespoons oil or ghee (clarified butter)
Fresh cilantro leaves, chopped for garnishing</p>
Instructions:

<p>Drain the soaked lentils and rinse them under cold water. In a pressure cooker, combine the lentils and 3 cups of water. Add turmeric powder and salt. Cook the lentils for about 3-4 whistles or until they are soft and mushy.

In a separate pan, heat oil or ghee. Add cumin seeds and mustard seeds. Once they start spluttering, add chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.

Add minced garlic, grated ginger, and green chili. Sauté for another 1-2 minutes until the raw smell disappears.

Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they become soft and oil starts to separate from the masala.

Add red chili powder, cumin powder, coriander powder, and garam masala. Mix well and cook for a couple of minutes.

Pour the cooked lentils into the masala mixture and bring it to a gentle simmer. Add more water if needed to reach your desired consistency.

Adjust salt and spices according to your taste. Let the dal simmer for 8-10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.

Garnish with chopped cilantro leaves.

Serve the masoor dal hot with steamed rice or Indian bread (roti, naan).

Enjoy your homemade masoor dal!</p>
