                Ingredients:

<p>2 cups cauliflower florets
1 large potato, peeled and diced
1 onion, finely chopped
2 tomatoes, chopped
2-3 cloves garlic, minced
1-inch piece of ginger, minced
1 green chili, slit (adjust to taste)
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 teaspoon turmeric powder
1 teaspoon cumin powder
1 teaspoon coriander powder
½ teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)
Salt to taste
2 tablespoons oil
Fresh cilantro leaves for garnishing</p>
Instructions:

<p>Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.
Add chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.
Add minced ginger, garlic, and green chili. Sauté for a minute until fragrant.
Add the chopped tomatoes, turmeric powder, cumin powder, coriander powder, red chili powder, and salt. Cook until the tomatoes become soft and the oil starts to separate.
Add the diced potatoes and cauliflower florets. Mix well to coat the vegetables with the spices.
Cover the pan and let the vegetables cook on low heat, stirring occasionally. If needed, you can sprinkle a little water to prevent sticking.
Cook until the potatoes and cauliflower are tender but not mushy. This should take about 15-20 minutes.
Once the vegetables are cooked, garnish with freshly chopped cilantro leaves.
Serve hot with roti, naan, or rice.
Enjoy your homemade Aloo Gobi!</p>
