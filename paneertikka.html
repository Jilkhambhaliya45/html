            <td colspan="3" rowspan="4">Ingredients:

               <p> 250g paneer (cottage cheese), cut into cubes
                1/2 cup thick yogurt
                1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste
                1 tablespoon red chili powder
                1/2 tablespoon turmeric powder
                1 tablespoon cumin powder
                1 tablespoon coriander powder
                1 tablespoon garam masala
                1 tablespoon lemon juice
                Salt to taste
                1 tablespoon oil
                Bell peppers, onions, and tomatoes (cut into chunks, for skewering)
                Butter or oil for basting</p><br>
                Instructions:
                
              <p>  In a bowl, mix the yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, cumin powder, coriander powder, garam masala, lemon juice, salt, and oil to make the marinade.
                
                Add the paneer cubes to the marinade and coat them well. Let them marinate for at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator.
                
                While the paneer is marinating, soak wooden skewers in water for about 20-30 minutes to prevent them from burning during grilling.
                
                Preheat your grill or stovetop griddle pan on medium-high heat.
                
                Thread the marinated paneer cubes, along with chunks of bell peppers, onions, and tomatoes, onto the soaked skewers.
                
                Brush the grill or griddle with oil to prevent sticking. Place the skewers on the grill or griddle and cook for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until the paneer and vegetables are nicely charred and cooked.
                
                Baste the paneer and vegetables with a little butter or oil while grilling for added flavor.
                
                Once cooked, remove the skewers from the grill and serve the paneer tikka hot, garnished with some chopped coriander leaves.
                
                You can also serve it with mint chutney and lemon wedges on the side.
                
                Enjoy your delicious homemade paneer tikka!
                
                Note: If you don't have a grill or griddle, you can also bake the skewers in a preheated oven at 200°C (400°F) for about 15-20 minutes or until cooked through, turning them halfway through the baking time.</p>
