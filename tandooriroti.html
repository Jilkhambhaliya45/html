                Ingredients:

<p>2 cups whole wheat flour (atta)
1/2 teaspoon salt
Water, as needed</p>
Instructions:

<p>In a mixing bowl, combine the whole wheat flour and salt.

Slowly add water and knead the dough until it's smooth and soft. The dough should not be too sticky or too dry. Adjust water accordingly.

Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 20-30 minutes. This helps the dough to become more pliable.

Preheat your tandoor or oven to its highest temperature. If you're using an oven, set it to the highest temperature (usually around 500°F or 260°C) and use the "broil" mode.

Divide the rested dough into small lemon-sized balls.

Take one dough ball, flatten it slightly, and dust it with a little dry flour.

Roll out the dough ball into a flat disc of about 6-8 inches in diameter, using a rolling pin.

Carefully place the rolled dough onto the hot tandoor wall or oven rack. It should stick to the surface.

Cook for about 2-3 minutes until the roti puffs up and gets some charred spots. You can use tongs to carefully flip it and cook the other side.

Once both sides are cooked and have a nice golden-brown color with some charred spots, remove the roti from the tandoor or oven.

Optionally, you can brush the roti with a little ghee or butter for extra flavor.

Serve the tandoori roti hot with your favorite curries, vegetables, or lentils.

Enjoy your homemade tandoori roti!</p>
