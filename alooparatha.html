                Ingredients:

                <p>2 cups whole wheat flour
                2 medium-sized potatoes, boiled and mashed
                1 teaspoon cumin seeds
                1 teaspoon red chili powder
                1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
                1 teaspoon garam masala
                1 tablespoon finely chopped green chilies (adjust to taste)
                1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh coriander leaves
                Salt, to taste
                Ghee or oil, for cooking</p>
                Instructions:
                
                <p>In a mixing bowl, combine the whole wheat flour with a pinch of salt. Add water little by little to knead into a soft dough. Cover the dough and let it rest for about 15-20 minutes.
                
                In a separate bowl, mix the mashed potatoes, cumin seeds, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, chopped green chilies, chopped coriander leaves, and salt. Mix everything well to create the potato filling.
                
                Divide the dough and the potato filling into equal portions. Take a portion of the dough, flatten it slightly, and place a portion of the potato filling in the center.
                
                Seal the edges of the dough to enclose the potato filling and form a ball.
                
                Roll out the stuffed ball gently into a flat, round paratha, using a rolling pin and some dry flour for dusting.
                
                Heat a tawa (griddle) over medium heat. Place the rolled paratha on the tawa and cook for about 1-2 minutes on one side, or until you see small bubbles forming.
                
                Flip the paratha and spread a little ghee or oil on the cooked side. Cook for another 1-2 minutes, pressing gently with a spatula to help it cook evenly.
                
                Flip again and spread ghee or oil on the other side. Press down with the spatula and cook until both sides are golden brown and crispy.
                
                Repeat the process with the remaining dough and filling to make more parathas.
                
                Serve the hot and delicious Aloo Parathas with yogurt, pickle, or chutney.
                
                Enjoy your homemade Aloo Parathas!
                
                Feel free to customize the spices and flavors according to your preference.</p>
