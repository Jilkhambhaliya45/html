            Devi Shailaputri, also spelled Shailputri, is the first among the Navadurga Devi’s and is worshipped on the first day of Navaratri¹. The name Shailaputri means the daughter of Mountains (Shaila means mountain and Putri means daughter), also known as Parvathi (Daughter of Parvatha- Himavantha), Haimavathi (Daughter of snow-capped one) gives the same meaning¹. 

She is none other than Goddess Parvati. This incarnation of Goddess Shailaputri occurred after Goddess Sati has offered her body in the yogic fire during Daksha’s Yagna¹. Worshipping this Goddess is known to fulfill the wishes of the devotee along with her mercy¹.

Goddess Shailaputri is described in several hymns, Agamas as the one riding on a bull, adorned with a crescent moon on her head and having two hands in which the right one is described holding a trident and the left holding a lotus². In some depictions, the lotus on her left hand is replaced by a Damaru (drum)².

She is considered to be the first manifestation of Goddess Durga². She is a form of Shakti and is the consort of Lord Shiva². She represents the collective power of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva².

Goddess Shailaputri also plays an important role in the Kundalini vidya, as she is known to be associated with the Muladhara chakra of Kundalini².
