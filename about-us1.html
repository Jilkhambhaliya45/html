                    Navratri, meaning "nine nights," is a significant Hindu festival dedicated to the goddess Durga. Celebrated twice a year, it symbolizes the triumph of good over evil. The festival involves fasting, feasting, dancing, and prayer over nine nights, with each night dedicated to different aspects of the divine feminine principle, or shakti. The dances performed include garba, especially in Gujarat. The festival concludes with the Dussehra celebration on the 10th day. In 2023, Navratri will be observed from October 15th to October 24th.
