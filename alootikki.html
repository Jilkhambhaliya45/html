                Ingredients:

<p>4 large potatoes, boiled and mashed
1/2 cup breadcrumbs
1/4 cup finely chopped onions
2 green chilies, finely chopped (adjust to taste)
2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves
1 teaspoon ginger paste
1 teaspoon chaat masala
1/2 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)
1/2 teaspoon cumin powder
Salt to taste
Oil for shallow frying</p>
Instructions:

<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the mashed potatoes, breadcrumbs, chopped onions, green chilies, ginger paste, coriander leaves, chaat masala, red chili powder, cumin powder, and salt. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly incorporated.
Divide the mixture into equal portions and shape them into round patties or tikkis.
Heat a pan over medium heat and add a little oil for shallow frying.
Once the oil is hot, carefully place the tikkis in the pan. Cook them until they are golden brown and crispy on both sides. You can also use a non-stick pan or a griddle for healthier cooking.
Once cooked, remove the tikkis from the pan and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to absorb any excess oil.
Serve the aloo tikkis hot with mint chutney, tamarind chutney, or yogurt on the side. You can also assemble them into delicious aloo tikki chaat with additional toppings like chopped onions, tomatoes, sev, and more chutneys.
Enjoy your homemade aloo tikkis!</p>
