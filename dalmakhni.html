                Ingredients:

<p>1 cup whole black lentils (urad dal)
1/4 cup red kidney beans (rajma)
4 cups water (for soaking)
3 tablespoons butter or ghee
1 large onion, finely chopped
2 tomatoes, pureed
1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)
1 teaspoon garam masala
1 teaspoon coriander powder
1/2 cup heavy cream
Salt to taste
Chopped cilantro (coriander leaves) for garnishing</p>
Instructions:

<p>Wash the black lentils and kidney beans thoroughly. Soak them together in 4 cups of water overnight or for at least 8 hours.

Drain and rinse the soaked lentils and beans. Transfer them to a pressure cooker, add 4 cups of water, and cook until soft and tender (around 15-20 whistles on medium heat). You can also cook them in a pot, but it will take longer.

In a separate pan, heat butter or ghee. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter. Add chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.

Add ginger-garlic paste and sauté for a minute until the raw smell disappears.

Stir in the tomato puree and cook until the mixture thickens and the oil separates from it.

Add turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, and garam masala. Cook the spices for a couple of minutes to enhance their flavor.

Once the lentils and beans are cooked, mash them slightly with the back of a spoon or a masher. Add the mashed lentils and beans to the tomato-spice mixture. Mix well.

Add salt and heavy cream to the dal. Allow it to simmer on low heat for about 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally. If the dal becomes too thick, you can add some water to achieve your desired consistency.

Adjust the seasoning if needed. If you prefer a smoother texture, you can use an immersion blender to partially blend the dal.

Once the dal is well-cooked and the flavors have melded together, garnish with chopped cilantro.

Serve hot with naan, rice, or roti.

Enjoy your homemade Dal Makhani!

Feel free to adjust the spice levels and ingredients according to your preferences</p>
